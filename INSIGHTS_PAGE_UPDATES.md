## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Image Fetching
```typescript
// Events: getEventImages(eventId) from imageUpload service
// Blog: getPostImages(postId) from imageUpload service

const images = eventImages[event.id] || [];
const primaryImage = images.find(img => img.is_primary) || images[0];
const displayImage = primaryImage?.image_url || event.image;
```

### Dialog Structure
- Fixed overlay with backdrop blur
- Centered modal with max-width constraints
- Click outside to close
- Stop propagation on modal content
- Scrollable content sections

### Event Propagation
```typescript
// Prevent card click when interacting with buttons
onClick={(e) => { 
  e.stopPropagation(); 
  // button action
}}
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Large hero image** (if available)
2. **Bold title** immediately draws attention
3. **Metadata** (date, location, attendees) with icons
4. **Content** in readable font size
5. **Action buttons** clearly separated

### Accessibility
- ✅ Semantic HTML elements (article, section, button)
- ✅ Alt text on all images
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support (ESC to close)
- ✅ Focus states on interactive elements
- ✅ Proper heading hierarchy

### Responsive Design
- **Desktop**: Full modal dialogs with side-by-side layouts
- **Tablet**: Adjusted column counts and padding
- **Mobile**: Stacked layouts, touch-friendly button sizes

## 📸 Image Management

### Storage Structure
```
event-images/
  ├── {event-id}/
  │   ├── image1.jpg
  │   ├── image2.png
  │   └── ...

post-images/
  ├── {post-id}/
  │   ├── image1.jpg
  │   ├── image2.png
  │   └── ...
```

### Database Tables
```sql
event_images
  - id
  - event_id (foreign key)
  - image_url
  - is_primary
  - display_order
  - created_at

post_images
  - id
  - post_id (foreign key)
  - image_url
  - is_primary
  - display_order
  - created_at
```

### Image Display Logic
1. Fetch all images for entity
2. Find primary image (is_primary = true)
3. If no primary, use first image
4. If no images in database, fallback to legacy image_url field
5. If still no image, show placeholder gradient
