## üöÄ **How to Push Changes (Safe Method)**

### **Option 1: Push Everything (Recommended)**

```bash
# Step 1: Add all changes
git add .

# Step 2: Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: Add firm profile updates, WhatsApp integration, and new About sections"

# Step 3: Push to remote
git push origin master
```

### **Option 2: Push Selectively (More Control)**

```bash
# Add only specific files
git add src/components/common/WhatsAppButton.tsx
git add src/components/common/Layout.tsx
git add src/data/companyInfo.ts
# ... add other files you want

# Commit
git commit -m "feat: Add WhatsApp integration and company data"

# Push
git push origin master
```

---

## üîÑ **How to Revert Changes (If Needed)**

### **Scenario 1: Revert BEFORE Pushing**

If you haven't pushed yet and want to undo changes:

```bash
# Undo all uncommitted changes (DANGEROUS - loses all changes)
git reset --hard HEAD

# Undo changes to specific file only
git checkout -- src/components/common/Layout.tsx

# Undo all changes but keep new files
git reset --hard HEAD
# Then manually delete new files you don't want
```

### **Scenario 2: Revert AFTER Pushing**

If you've already pushed and want to go back:

**Method A: Revert Last Commit (Safe - Creates New Commit)**
```bash
# This creates a new commit that undoes the last commit
git revert HEAD

# Push the revert
git push origin master
```

**Method B: Go Back to Specific Commit**
```bash
# Step 1: See commit history
git log --oneline

# Step 2: Find the commit hash you want to go back to (e.g., abc1234)
# Step 3: Revert to that commit
git revert abc1234

# Step 4: Push
git push origin master
```

**Method C: Hard Reset (DANGEROUS - Rewrites History)**
```bash
# Only use if you're sure and working alone!
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
git push --force origin master
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **Safety Best Practices**

### **Before Pushing:**
1. ‚úÖ Review changes: `git status`
2. ‚úÖ Check what changed: `git diff`
3. ‚úÖ Test the website locally
4. ‚úÖ Commit with clear message

### **Create a Backup Branch (Super Safe):**
```bash
# Create backup of current state
git branch backup-before-push

# Now you can push to master safely
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push origin master

# If something goes wrong, you can always:
git checkout backup-before-push
```

## üìù **Recommended Commit Message**

```bash
git commit -m "feat: Major website updates from firm profile

- Add WhatsApp integration (floating button + contact page)
- Add comprehensive company information (mission, accreditations, client sectors)
- Create AccreditationsSection component (11 certifications)

```

## üéØ **Step-by-Step: Safe Push Process**

### **1. Create Safety Backup**
```bash
git branch backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### **2. Stage Changes**
```bash
git add .
```

### **3. Review Staged Changes**
```bash
git status
```

### **4. Commit**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add firm profile updates and WhatsApp integration"
```

### **5. Push**
```bash
git push origin master
```

### **6. Verify on GitHub/Remote**
- Go to your repository
- Check that files are updated
- Verify nothing broke

---

## üÜò **Emergency: Undo Last Push**

If you pushed and immediately regret it:

```bash
# Step 1: Revert the last commit locally
git revert HEAD

# Step 2: Push the revert
git push origin master
```

This creates a new commit that undoes your changes, keeping history clean.

---

## üìä **Check Your Git History**

```bash
# See recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# See what changed in last commit
git show HEAD

# See all branches
git branch -a
```

---

## üí° **Pro Tips**

### **Tip 1: Always Test Before Pushing**
```bash
# Make sure dev server runs
npm run dev

# Check for errors
npm run build
```

### **Tip 2: Use Descriptive Commit Messages**
Good: `feat: Add WhatsApp integration with floating button`
Bad: `update files`

### **Tip 3: Commit Often**
- Small, frequent commits are better than large ones
- Easier to revert specific changes
- Better history tracking

### **Tip 4: Never Force Push (Unless You're Sure)**
```bash
# AVOID THIS unless you know what you're doing
git push --force
```

---

## üîç **Useful Git Commands**

```bash
# See what changed
git diff

# See what changed in specific file
git diff src/components/common/Layout.tsx

# See status
git status

# See commit history
git log --oneline

# See all branches
git branch

# Discard changes to specific file
git checkout -- filename.tsx

# Unstage file (but keep changes)
git reset HEAD filename.tsx

# See who changed what
git blame filename.tsx
```

2. **You Can Always Go Back** - Every commit is a save point
3. **Branches Are Free** - Create as many backup branches as you want
4. **Test Locally First** - Always verify changes work before pushing
5. **Communicate with Team** - If working with others, let them know about major changes
